          <p>
            We present TELESIM, a modular and plug-and-play framework for direct
            teleoperation of a robotic arm using a digital twin as the interface
            between the user and the robotic system.
          </p>
          <p>
            We tested TELESIM by performing a user survey with 37 participants
            on two different robots using two different control modalities: a
            virtual reality controller and a finger mapping hardware controller
            using different grasping systems. Users were asked to teleoperate
            the robot to pick and place 3 cubes in a tower and to repeat this
            task as many times as possible in 10 minutes, with only 5 minutes of
            training beforehand.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our experimental results show that most users were able to succeed
            by building at least a tower of 3 cubes regardless of the control
            modality or robot used, demonstrating the user-friendliness of
            TELESIM.

          The controllers (in the black dotted line)(1) can be any system that
          outputs a 3D pose, while our framework is depicted in the blue dotted
          line. It accepts the pose given by (1) to update the 3D pose of a cube
          in the digital twin. The robot then calculates a path to this cube in
          real-time, while avoiding collision with the world (4). Finally,
          TELESIM can be plugged into any robotic system (6) via a ROS2 robot
          controller (5)\, as shown in the red dotted line.

          The Steam Index VR Headset is marked as (1) on the far left, which
          acts as the worldâ€™s origin. The Baxter robot on the left (2) is
          controlled by the Steam Index controller (5). In front of it, the UR3
          is on the right (3), with the Yale OpenHand T42 gripper, controlled by
          the Senseglove and HTC Vive tracker (4) on the left side of the brown
          table. Additionally, in the upper right corner (7), a view of the
          starting setup of the task, which consists of 3 cubes in a triangle
          pattern, while on the brown table, the cubes are arranged in the goal
          configuration (6).

          85% of the participants can build at least one tower in 10 minutes
          using Baxter and the VR controller. However, there is a steady decline
          for each of the following towers, with only 5% of the users able to
          build 8 towers. This is in direct comparison to the UR3, with slightly
          less than 50% of the population failing to build one tower and 5%
          managing to build 4, half as many towers for Baxter.

            We thank the University of Glasgow for the use of the Baxter robot
            and the UR3 robot. We also thank the EPSCR for funding this
            research. Finally we thank all the participants who took part in our
            experiments.
