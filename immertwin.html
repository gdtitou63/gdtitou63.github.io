                We present IMMERTWIN, a mixed reality framework for enhance robotic 
                arm teleoperation using a digital twin as a bridge for interaction 
                between the user and the robotics devices.
              </p>
              <p>
                We evaluated IMMERTWIN by performing a medium scale user survey with
                26 participants on two different robots. Users were asked to teleoperate 
                both robots inside the virtual environment to pick and place 3 cubes 
                in a tower and to repeat this task as many times as possible in 10 minutes,
                with only 5 minutes of training beforehand.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our experimental results show that most users were able to succeed by 
                building at least a tower of 3 cubes regardless of the robot used. 
                In addition user's preferred to use the IMMERTWIN over our previous 
                work TELESIM, as it caused them less mental workload.

              Our framework, IMMERWTIN, shown in the green dotted line, accepts the pose of any 3D VR controller (shown in the black
              dotted line) to update the position of the user's virtual hand in Unreal Engine. The user can then grab the robotic
              gripper and move the robot where they want. The new robotic goal is then transmitted to TELESIM (shown in the blue
              dotted line) to perform motion planning and collision avoidance. The state of the virtual robot is then transmitted to
              the real robot, shown in the red dotted line, to update its position. Finally, the state of the real robot is
              transmitted back into Unreal Engine to create a closed-loop digital twin.

Our experimental setup comprises the following components: (1) The view from the user inside Unreal Engine, with their
virtual hands (4) and the virtual gripper (5). (2) The room containing both the Baxter robot (8) and the UR3 (7), along
with 4 ZED 2I cameras (9). (3) The user wearing the VR headset, with the black security tape (6).

IMMERTWIN was favoured by most participants who had previously used TELESIM. This preference underscores the potential benefits
of immersive VR environments in enhancing user experience, even if quantifiable performance gains are not immediately
evident. The mental effort required by IMMERTWIN was significantly lower than that of TELESIM, suggesting that the
immersive nature of the VR environment may alleviate cognitive load. However, physical effort remained at the same
level, particularly with the UR3 in TELESIM, which was noted to be more exhausting than other setups. This highlights
the need for further refinement in balancing cognitive and physical demands in VR-based teleoperation systems.
