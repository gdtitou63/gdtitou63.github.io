            We present IMMERTWIN, a mixed reality framework for enhance robotic
            arm teleoperation using a digital twin as a bridge for interaction
            between the user and the robotics devices.
          </p>
          <p>
            We evaluated IMMERTWIN by performing a medium scale user survey with
            26 participants on two different robots. Users were asked to
            teleoperate both robots inside the virtual environment to pick and
            place 3 cubes in a tower and to repeat this task as many times as
            possible in 10 minutes, with only 5 minutes of training beforehand.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our experimental results show that most users were able to succeed
            by building at least a tower of 3 cubes regardless of the robot
            used. In addition user's preferred to use the IMMERTWIN over our
            previous work TELESIM, as it caused them less mental workload.

          Our framework, IMMERWTIN, shown in the green dotted line, accepts the
          pose of any 3D VR controller (shown in the black dotted line) to
          update the position of the user's virtual hand in Unreal Engine. The
          user can then grab the robotic gripper and move the robot where they
          want. The new robotic goal is then transmitted to TELESIM (shown in
          the blue dotted line) to perform motion planning and collision
          avoidance. The state of the virtual robot is then transmitted to the
          real robot, shown in the red dotted line, to update its position.
          Finally, the state of the real robot is transmitted back into Unreal
          Engine to create a closed-loop digital twin.

          Our experimental setup comprises the following components: (1) The
          view from the user inside Unreal Engine, with their virtual hands (4)
          and the virtual gripper (5). (2) The room containing both the Baxter
          robot (8) and the UR3 (7), along with 4 ZED 2I cameras (9). (3) The
          user wearing the VR headset, with the black security tape (6).

            Participants of IMMERTWIN successfully constructed a maximum of 10
            towers with both robots. Notably, users operating the UR3 with
            IMMERTWIN consistently completed more towers than participants using
            any other robot across both TELESIM and IMMERTWIN.

          IMMERTWIN was favoured by most participants who had previously used
          TELESIM. This preference underscores the potential benefits of
          immersive VR environments in enhancing user experience, even if
          quantifiable performance gains are not immediately evident. The mental
          effort required by IMMERTWIN was significantly lower than that of
          TELESIM, suggesting that the immersive nature of the VR environment
          may alleviate cognitive load. However, physical effort remained at the
          same level, particularly with the UR3 in TELESIM, which was noted to
          be more exhausting than other setups. This highlights the need for
          further refinement in balancing cognitive and physical demands in
          VR-based teleoperation systems.
