          Computer-based analysis of images to extract information and classify
          their contents is becoming increasingly important in all walks of
          life. For example, by combining the science of 'photogrammetry'
          (measurement using cameras) with digital camera technology it becomes
          possible to capture 3D models of people, animals and objects that are
          metrically accurate and photo-realistic in appearance. Furthermore, it
          is possible to analyse and animate these models for applications such
          as virtual actors or sports science.

          CVAS investigates fundamental issues of how to analyse images and also
          how apply this knowledge within practical applications. Our projects
          cover all aspects of human body modelling in 3D, including animation
          and surface skin modelling, robotic perception and manipulation,
          materials, informatics of perception and distributed systems. This
          approach opens a broad range of application areas such as; creative
          media, engineering, medicine, textiles & clothing, military &
          security, internet & communications, forensic and fine art. A key
          objective of the work of the group is to combine 3D measurement and
          modelling techniques with image understanding approaches to
          constructing cognitive robot vision systems that actively search their
          operating environments using digital cameras.
